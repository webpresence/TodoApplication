Home task.

One thing we typically do as a next step in the process, is we ask that you create a basic TODO list app, spending no more than a few hours total on the project. Don’t worry about completing each requirement or fully implementing a specific technology – just take a crack at it, push it to GitHub, and send us the link.

Keep it very simple. Your app will just maintain a single/global TODO list. When running the app, the user should be able to add items, delete items, and mark items as completed to the current TODO list. Some specifics on what we’d like to see:

Create a MVC web project using .NET Core
Use SQL Server, with Entity Framework code-first for data access and LINQ for any queries
Leverage the Controllers within the MVC project for routing to Views as well as any API functionality
No scope creep -- you don’t have to add the ability to manage multiple lists within the app (e.g. “grocery list” vs “personal list” etc.)
Optional: use VueJS for basic data binding, but don’t use VueJS for routing, state, or components (i.e. no need to create a true single-page application)
